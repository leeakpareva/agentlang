1. Research and Purchase Land
The first step is finding and purchasing a suitable piece of land to build on. Land can be extremely expensive in London so factor this into your budget. Consider things like location, size, access, permissions, and existing structures.

2. Apply for Planning Permission
You will need to apply for planning permission from your local council before you can start building. This involves submitting detailed architectural plans for approval to ensure it meets policies and regulations for size, design, etc. Hire an architect to create viable plans.

3. Find and Hire a Builder
Look for an experienced local construction company or builder that specializes in building houses in London. Get multiple quotes before selecting one. Make sure to check references and examples of past projects.

4. Finalize House Design and Layout
Work closely with your builder and architect to choose layouts, materials, fixtures and finishes for the home. Customize the design to fit your lifestyle. Be realistic within budget constraints.

5. Secure Funding
Building a new custom home requires significant financing. Figure out whether you will self-fund, take out a construction loan or use a combination. Banks can give loan against the land.

6. Begin Construction
Once permits and funding are in place, construction can begin! The builder will manage each phase - foundation, framing, roofing, plumbing, etc. The build usually takes around 12-24 months with council inspections at each stage.`,
